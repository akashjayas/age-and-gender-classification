# age-and-gender-classification
Age Prediction should be approached as a Regression problem since we are expecting a real number as the output. However, estimating age accurately using regression is challenging. Even humans cannot accurately predict the age based on looking at a person. However, we have an idea of whether they are in their 20s or in their 30s.
for women arg value is 0
for men arg value is 1
age and gender both have different approrch to deals with them it is depends upon your logic.

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. ... OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays.
it have pre define module like face detection , imotion detection etc.
